Safety sentinel using machine learning
Road accidents are one of the most regrettable hazards in this hectic world. Road accidents lead to numerous casualties, injuries, and fatalities each year, as well as significant economic losses. There are many factors that contribute to road accidents, especially those related to the environment, vehicles and the travelers.Despite many precautionary measures and safety measures to reduce road accidentit remains one of the uncontrollable. By analyzing the severity of the road accidents that happened in the past, and the factors that caused it, it is possible to take  precautionary measures to reduce road accidents rate significantly in the future. Machinelearning plays a vital role in analyzing the data and makes future predictions based on the existing data. Data mining using classification algorithms such as random forest classifier (RFC) can be utilized to develop a predictive model by feature extraction for predicting the severity of the road traffic accidents. Predicting road accidents and identifying high-risk areas and conditions can enable proactive measures to prevent accidents and save lives. This study focuses on developing a predictive model for road accidents using machine learning techniques, leveraging diverse data sources such as historical accident data, weather conditions, traffic  density, and road characteristics. By analyzing patterns and correlations withinthe data, the model aims to accurately predict the likelihood of accidents under varying conditions and provide real-time alerts. The proposed solution incorporates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, followed by rigorous evaluation to optimize accuracy. Using historical accident data, we apply data preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and employ classification algorithms including Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to predict the severity levels of accidents minor, severe, or fatal.
